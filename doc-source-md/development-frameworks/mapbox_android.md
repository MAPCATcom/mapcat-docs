# Using MAPCAT maps on Android

You can visualize [MAPCAT](https://mapcat.com) maps on Android devices using our [Mapbox GL Native](https://github.com/MAPCATcom/mapbox-gl-native) fork which offers you a browser-independent, native solution for rendering Mapcat maps.

## Access token

In order to use the test app, you have to get a [MAPCAT access token](https://pro.mapcat.com/planpricing/).

## Building the test app
[Here](https://github.com/MAPCATcom/mapbox-gl-native/tree/mapcat-master/platform/android) is a quick guide on how to build and deploy the Mapcat Android TestApp to your Android device.
